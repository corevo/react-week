## Albums
* Display a list of albums with their album art (personnaly I like *guns n' roses*)
* When presses I'll be redirected to said album with **history api** should look like `http://localhost/:album`
* Within each album, I'll see it's `name`, `artist`, `album art` and a `list of songs`
* I can **add** and **remove** songs from the album
* If I go to a different album and return to the album from before, my **changes will be kept**

*Note* changes doesn't need to be kept over refreshes
